Visualiser with Processing.js
============================

This visualiser for spotify is based on the work of [Daan Van Hasselt](http://www.daanvanhasselt.com/essays/2013/08/creating-a-spotify-visualiser/).

Now you can choose the colour of the visualisation and the you are able to change between different styles.
At the moment there is a circle and bars visualisation available.

To test the application your Spotify account needs to have the developer flag
set. You can find out how to activate the developer flag [here](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/#developer-account).

Clone this repository in your Spotify workspace directory. If you haven't got a Spotify directory, read about where to create it [here](http://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/guidelines/developer/#creatinganapp). Cloning will create a subfolder called audio-fft-processing.

You can access the application (restart the Spotify desktop client if you have not done so) by typing in spotify:app:audio-fft-processing in the search field.
Read more about this in the [Spotify Developer Guidelines](http://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/guidelines/developer/).
